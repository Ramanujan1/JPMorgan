1) MessageHandler is the Core class that handles all the processing
2) SalesRepository is used to store all the sales related data over time for all the messages processed for a queue instance.
3) Message is the Entity class which is the message structure.
4) I have used Hash Map for storing data as I consider lookup key value pair data to be best stored in this datastructure.
5) I have used BigDecimal for accurate math value storage and manipulation.
6) You can run the TestMessageHander.java for all scenarios to be tested as mentioned in the task
7) The message handler has been written with the consideration that this is a single threaded appliication.
